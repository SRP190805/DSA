## Binary Trees

A Binary Tree is a fundamental data structure where each node can have a maximum of two child nodes: a left child and a right child. This restriction offers several advantages:

* **Efficient Algorithms:** Traversal, searching, insertion, and deletion become simpler, faster to implement, and have better performance.
* **Fast Searching (Binary Search Trees):** By keeping data sorted, Binary Search Trees (BSTs) enable efficient searching.
* **Easier Balancing:** With a limited number of child nodes, balancing trees becomes more manageable, as seen with AVL Binary Trees.
* **Memory Efficiency:** Binary Trees can be represented as arrays, making them memory-efficient.

**Components of a Binary Tree:**

* **Parent Node (Internal Node):** A node with one or two child nodes.
* **Left Child Node:** The child node located to the left.
* **Right Child Node:** The child node located to the right.
* **Tree Height:** The maximum number of edges from the root node to a leaf node.

**Binary Trees vs. Arrays and Linked Lists:**

* **Arrays:** Efficient for direct access (e.g., accessing element 700 in a 1000-element array). However, inserting or deleting elements requires shifting other elements in memory, making it time-consuming.
* **Linked Lists:** Fast for insertion or deletion (no memory shifting). But accessing an element necessitates traversing the entire list, which is slow.
* **Binary Trees (BSTs and AVL Trees):** Offer a balance between Arrays and Linked Lists. They allow fast access, insertion, and deletion without memory shifts.

**Types of Binary Trees:**

Here's an overview of different Binary Tree structures:

* **Balanced Binary Tree:** The height difference between a node's left and right subtrees is at most 1.
* **Complete Binary Tree:** All levels are full except possibly the last level, which can be full or filled from left to right. A complete Binary Tree is inherently balanced.
* **Full Binary Tree:** Every node has either 0 or 2 child nodes.
* **Perfect Binary Tree:** All leaf nodes reside on the same level, and all levels are full. A perfect Binary Tree is also full, balanced, and complete.

**Implementation:**

Similar to a Singly Linked List, a Binary Tree can be implemented by creating a structure where each node can link to its left and right child nodes.

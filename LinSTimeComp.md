# Linear Search Time Complexity

Linear Search is a straightforward algorithm that searches through an array sequentially to find a specified value.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for Linear Search is **O(n)**.

### Explanation

- **Best Case**: If the target value is found at the beginning of the array, only one comparison is needed.
  
- **Worst Case**: If the target value is not found in the array or is found at the end, the algorithm needs to compare each element in the array, requiring **n** comparisons.

### Simulation

You can simulate Linear Search for different numbers of elements in an array to observe how the number of comparisons scales with the size of the array. Try searching for different values in the array to see how the algorithm behaves.

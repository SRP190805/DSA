### Explanation

- **Existing Data Structure**: Arrays are a built-in data structure in most programming languages, while linked lists typically require custom implementation.
  
- **Fixed Size**: Arrays have a fixed size after initialization, whereas linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically.

- **Memory Allocation**: Arrays store elements contiguously in memory, while linked list nodes are scattered in memory.

- **Direct Access**: Arrays allow direct access to elements using indices (random access), while linked lists require traversal from the head node to access elements.

- **Insertion/Deletion Efficiency**: Linked lists excel in insertion and deletion operations since they only require adjusting pointers, whereas arrays may require shifting elements.

This comparison helps in understanding the characteristics and trade-offs between arrays and linked lists, guiding their use in different programming scenarios.
